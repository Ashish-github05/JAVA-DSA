Selection sort:

Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 


The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. 
This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted. 

JAVA CODE :

// Java program for implementation of Selection Sort
import java.io.*;
public class SelectionSort
{
	void sort(int arr[])
	{
		int n = arr.length;

		for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
		{
			int min_idx = i;
			for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
				if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
					min_idx = j;

			int temp = arr[min_idx];
			arr[min_idx] = arr[i];
			arr[i] = temp;
		}
	}

	void printArray(int arr[])
	{
		int n = arr.length;
		for (int i=0; i<n; ++i)
			System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
		System.out.println();
	}
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		SelectionSort ob = new SelectionSort();
		int arr[] = {64,25,12,22,11};
		ob.sort(arr);
		System.out.println("Sorted array");
		ob.printArray(arr);
	}
}
